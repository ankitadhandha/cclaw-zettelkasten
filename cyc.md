# Cyc

[Cyc](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyc) is a large general ontology.

The main Cyc ontology is commercial, but there is a research license, and no longer maintained [OpenCyc](https://web.archive.org/web/20170227201513/http://www.opencyc.org/). OpenCyc 4.0 can be downloaded on [GitHub](https://github.com/asanchez75/opencyc), and it requires [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase-jdk8-downloads.html).
