# Description logics


_Description logics_ (DL) are a family of logics, often used in ontologies.
(For more discussion on logics, see <logics_formalisms_languages_applications>)

Most DLs are decidable fragments of first-order logic. [Krötzsch et al. (2013)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.4089) explain that there are many DLs, because different applications require different expressivity from the logic.
There is a tradeoff between expressivity and performance: inferring easy things is fast, inferring complex things is slow (or undecidable).
