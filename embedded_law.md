# Embedded law


[Genesereth (2015)](http://complaw.stanford.edu/readings/complaw.pdf) gives an example where legal information is important as a part of other applications.

Architects need to design buildings that (a) don't fall down, and (b) comply with regulations. For purpose (a), they can use [CAD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-aided_design) software, and for purpose (b) they can read law text.

A step forward is <legal_expert_systems>: the architect doesn't need to read pages and pages of legislation or hire a lawyer, but they can use an app to query if their desired door width is legal or not.

If the CAD program provides legal assistance, that's an example of _embedded law_. The same application will tell you if your design defies the laws of physics or the laws of your country.
